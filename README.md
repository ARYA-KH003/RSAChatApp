ClientSideSecureChat is a safe and simple messaging app. All messages are encrypted and decrypted on your device, so no one (not even the server) can see your messages.

Features
End-to-End Encryption: Messages are encrypted on your device and only the recipient can decrypt them.
Your Keys, Your Control: Private keys stay on your device. Public keys are shared for secure communication.
Server is Blind: The server only stores encrypted messages and public keys â€“ no plaintext or private keys.
How it Works
Register: Generate your keys on your device.
Send Messages: Encrypt messages with your friend's public key.
Read Messages: Decrypt messages with your private key.
